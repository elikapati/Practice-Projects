This project binary classifies sonar frequency data penetrated against Rocks and Metals.
A collection of 208 samples with 60 features having
- Rock samples
- Metal samples

We apply simple neural network model with "StratifiedKFold" on data as the samples are not in equal proportion on the data to baseline its performance
We use Standardization to bring the data to 0 mean and std deviation of 1, apply the model to see performance improvement
We also create a smaller network and larger network to see watch for performance gain
