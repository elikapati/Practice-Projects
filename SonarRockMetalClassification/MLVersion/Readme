This program binary classifies samples from the sonar features into Rock or Metal.
- Objective is to predict the house price from the features. 
- Studied the data distributions carefully and picked up 
  - 3 linear models - Linear regression(LR), Lasso regression(LASSO), ElasticNet(EN); 
  - 3 non-linear algorithms CART 
     - (Classification and Regression Trees), 
     - Support vector regression(SVR), 
     - k-nearest neighbors(KNN) for evaluation. 
- Picked up KNN to be the best model and fine-tuned it to get the best results for the given data. 
- Applied ensembling technique methods 
  - Bagging (Random Forest, Extra Trees) and 
  - Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) to find the best model on the data as Gradient Boosting. 
- Fine-tuned the model on the data to get best fit from the optimal parameters.
