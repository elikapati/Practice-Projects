This project predicts house prices from the features using KerasRegressor of Keras using Scikit learn library
- It baselines the metrics taking the data as it is applying kfold cross validation
- It checks for improvement after standardizing data mean 0 and std deviation 1
- It verifies to see if it improves by creating 
  - larger network
  - wider network

I have the source code on my DELL Laptop at 
  - Exercises/Ex_DeepLearning/DL_Jason Brownlee/Book Deep Learning With Python/05d_Keras Regression with Scikit library on House Prices.ipynb
