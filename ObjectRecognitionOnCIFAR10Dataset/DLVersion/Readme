Objective is to classify and identify images to be one of 10 classes like airplane, car, horse, truck, etc. Initially developed a simple model to baseline the accuracy and add layers to capture the patterns, reduce the size to lower process complexity, ensure model to generalize well by introducing random knockout of neurons. We also check to see for performance improvements by increasing the depth of model with more layers. Apply image augmentation techniques to improve performance further.
